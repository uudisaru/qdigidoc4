      ID-software allows you to use your ID-card electronically – use
      private and governmental e-services, digitally sign documents
      and encrypt documents for safe transfer; the software includes
      utilities to manage (change pin codes, update certificates etc.)
      the Estonian ID-card.
    </p>
    <p>
      DigiDoc4 Client can be used to sign digitally with ID-card and Mobile-ID, 
      check the validity of digital signatures and open and save documents 
      inside the signature container. Digitally signed containers are files 
      with .bdoc or .asice extensions; read-only support is provided for older
      .ddoc format which can additionally be wrapped in .asics timestamped container.
    </p>
    <p>
      DigiDoc4 Client enables you also to secure files for safe transfer using
      your ID-card, and decrypt secured documents addressed to you. Securing or
      encrypting enables you to protect sensitive information from other
      people in the short term. The ID-card’s authentication certificate is
      used for encryption. A secure container file will be created upon
      encryption with the extension .cdoc.
